# Command-Based-cRIO
A command based code base for the cRIO

Do not edit the master branch for various mechanisms, the purpose of the master branch is to provide a functional, ready to use base for any cRio command based projects, either use a seperate project or a branch.
The showbot with whiffle ball cannon is using a branch for ease of access to changes to master, without modifying the basic drive system.
